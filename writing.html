<span class="section-title">Summary</span>
The story centers on Creed Isaacs, a man in his fifties attempting to rebuild his life after a long period of homelessness and addiction. Creed secures a job at a Fuel City gas station owned by Garfield Gallard. This new beginning is fraught with challenges. Creed faces disdain from his younger coworker, Steven McGee, who resents Creed's presence. Despite Creed's efforts, he is caught smoking on the job, a direct violation of Fuel City's policy due to the old gas pumps, and is subsequently terminated by Gallard.
Following his firing, Creed steals Steven's car from the Fuel City parking lot. In a state of desperation, Creed succumbs to his past and relapses with the help of an acquaintance, Siggy Meddlers.
Throughout Creed's experiences, the narrative interweaves surreal sequences set in a black and white hospital waiting room. This waiting room is populated mostly by older individuals, and a bored man named Pete manages a line leading to double doors that emit a blinding white light. Individuals who pass through these doors are consumed by the light and make cryptic remarks about Creed's situation, suggesting he is in for a ‚Äúrude awakening.‚Äù These scenes reinforce a theme of purgatory, a cyclical repetition of events and judgment. Notably, Garfield also experiences this unsettling waiting room, interacting with Shirley Conway and seemingly facing his own judgment. Gallard's attempt to help Shirley escape leads to an encounter with Anna, identified as his ‚Äúspirit guide.‚Äù Gallard is then confronted by a copy of himself who judges his life, and his office is engulfed in flames.
The story also introduces Erin Gallard, Garfield's daughter, who begins working at Fuel City. Steven has encounters with Erin outside of work, initially marked by Steven's awkward attempts at connection. Their relationship develops into a somewhat contentious but also developing connection as they share experiences and vulnerabilities, such as discussing Steven's stolen car and their fathers. Steven attends a party at Gallard's mansion while Gallard is away. At the party, Steven encounters Siggy, has a bizarre encounter with a raccoon in an upstairs bathroom, and inadvertently unleashes Howard, a giant crane, causing chaos.
The narrative reaches a violent climax when Creed returns to Fuel City, armed with a black pistol he stole from Siggy. In a heated confrontation, fueled by his anger and desperation, Creed shoots Gallard. This act triggers a chaotic escape in Steven's stolen car, with Erin unexpectedly joining him in the backseat, injured. Their escape is short-lived and ends abruptly as Steven's car is engulfed in orange light.
Following this fiery conclusion, the narrative returns to the hospital waiting room for Creed, reinforcing the sense of an inescapable situation. He then wakes up alone in Steven's car, stripped of the pistol, his money, cigarettes, and even the car keys. The grim consequences of his actions become apparent as Creed sees Fuel City engulfed in flames. Ultimately, Creed is apprehended by the police at the train station, seemingly after being set up by his brother Mike, who expresses a sorrowful farewell before the arrest. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the chaos, Steven and Erin find a moment of quiet connection, suggesting a potential shift in their relationship amidst the turmoil.

<span class="section-title">Main Characters</span>
‚Ä¢ Creed Isaacs (50, haggard): A man attempting to rebuild his life after homelessness and addiction. His arc is tragic, as his initial hope for a fresh start at Fuel City is quickly derailed by his past. After being fired, he relapses, and his desperation culminates in stealing Steven's car and ultimately committing a violent act by shooting Gallard. The surreal hospital waiting room sequences suggest he is in some form of purgatorial state, confronting his choices. His relationships are strained: he faces resentment from Steven, has a complicated history with his brother Mike, and is drawn back into his old life by Siggy.
‚Ä¢ Steven McGee (17, bratty): A teenage coworker at Fuel City who initially resents Creed. His arc involves the theft of his car, leading to an unexpected connection with Erin. He witnesses the escalating events at the gas station and finds a moment of quiet connection with Erin in the aftermath.
‚Ä¢ Garfield Gallard (59, powerful): The owner of Fuel City who gives Creed a chance but ultimately fires him for violating the no-smoking policy. He becomes a victim of Creed's violence. Gallard also experiences the unsettling hospital waiting room, where he encounters Shirley and seemingly faces his own judgment, guided (or confronted) by Anna and a copy of himself before being consumed by flames.
‚Ä¢ Erin Gallard (18, rebel): Garfield's teenage daughter who begins working at Fuel City. She has a somewhat contentious but developing connection with Steven. She is present during the violent confrontation at the gas station, is injured, and escapes with Creed in Steven's car. In the end, she shares a moment of connection with Steven.
‚Ä¢ Siggy Meddlers (29, relaxed): A friend from Creed's past who provides him with drugs, leading to his relapse, and later the black pistol. His presence at Fuel City further escalates the confrontation.
‚Ä¢ Mike Isaacs (46, prissy): Creed's brother who tries to look out for him, securing him the job at Fuel City. He is disappointed by Creed's actions and ultimately appears to facilitate Creed's arrest at the train station.
‚Ä¢ Anna (28, bubbly): Holding a dual role within the narrative, she is a seemingly ordinary, if somewhat observant, service worker for Creed in the ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù narrative at the So Swell Motel. Adversely, in the surreal hospital, she transcends this role, acting as a guide or intermediary for Garfield in what appears to be an afterlife or a space of judgment. She has specific knowledge about the individuals present, their deaths, and their potential for change. Her interactions with Gallard directly influence his experience in this space, and her appearance to escort Creed suggests a similar, yet unseen, process for him.

<span class="section-title">Genre</span>
The script blends crime thriller elements with dark drama and surreal/supernatural undertones. The stark black-and-white hospital waiting room sequences introduce a distinct element of the bizarre, hinting at themes of purgatory, judgment, and the afterlife.

<span class="section-title">Themes</span>
Major themes include desperation and its catastrophic consequences, the cyclical and destructive nature of addiction and relapse, the elusive possibility of redemption, the impact of
social class and limited opportunities, the weight of past actions and guilt, and the tenuous connections between individuals amidst chaos. The surreal elements suggest a deeper exploration of morality and consequence beyond the tangible world.

<span class="section-title">Tone</span>
The overall tone is dark, gritty, and often unsettling, punctuated by moments of tension, violence, and surreal unease. There are glimpses of dark humor, particularly in some of the waiting room interactions and character quirks, but the underlying feeling is one of impending doom and consequences.

<span class="section-title">Style</span>
The style is character-driven, focusing on the internal struggles and external pressures faced by Creed and the other main players. The narrative interweaves realistic dialogue and scenarios with highly stylized and symbolic sequences.

<span class="section-title">Message</span>
The script delivers a cautionary message about the destructive power of desperation and addiction, highlighting how past choices can irrevocably shape one's destiny. The surreal elements raise questions about judgment, redemption, and the potential for consequences that extend beyond the physical world. While the ending for Creed seems bleak, the nascent connection between Steven and Erin might offer a subtle suggestion of hope or the cyclical nature of life amidst tragedy.
