Summary:  
The story centers on Creed Isaacs, a man in his fifties attempting to rebuild his life after a long period of homelessness and addiction. Creed secures a job at a Fuel City gas station owned by Garfield Gallard. This new beginning is fraught with challenges. Creed faces disdain from his younger coworker, Steven McGee, who resents Creed's presence. Despite Creed's efforts, he is caught smoking on the job, a direct violation of Fuel City's policy due to the old gas pumps, and is subsequently terminated by Gallard.

Following his firing, Creed steals Steven's car from the Fuel City parking lot. In a state of desperation, Creed succumbs to his past and relapses with the help of an acquaintance, Siggy Meddlers.

Throughout Creed's experiences, the narrative interweaves surreal sequences set in a black and white hospital waiting room. This waiting room is populated mostly by older individuals, and a bored man named Pete manages a line leading to double doors that emit a blinding white light. Individuals who pass through these doors are consumed by the light and make cryptic remarks about Creed's situation, suggesting he is in for a ‚Äúrude awakening.‚Äù These scenes reinforce a theme of purgatory, a cyclical repetition of events and judgment. Notably, Garfield also experiences this unsettling waiting room, interacting with Shirley Conway and seemingly facing his own judgment. Gallard's attempt to help Shirley escape leads to an encounter with Anna, identified as his ‚Äúspirit guide.‚Äù Gallard is then confronted by a copy of himself who judges his life, and his office is engulfed in flames.

The story also introduces Erin Gallard, Garfield's daughter, who begins working at Fuel City. Steven has encounters with Erin outside of work, initially marked by Steven's awkward attempts at connection. Their relationship develops into a somewhat contentious but also developing connection as they share experiences and vulnerabilities, such as discussing Steven's stolen car and their fathers. Steven attends a party at Gallard's mansion while Gallard is away. At the party, Steven encounters Siggy, has a bizarre encounter with a raccoon in an upstairs bathroom, and inadvertently unleashes Howard, a giant crane, causing chaos.

The narrative reaches a violent climax when Creed returns to Fuel City, armed with a black pistol he stole from Siggy. In a heated confrontation, fueled by his anger and desperation, Creed shoots Gallard. This act triggers a chaotic escape in Steven's stolen car, with Erin unexpectedly joining him in the backseat, injured. Their escape is short-lived and ends abruptly as Steven's car is engulfed in orange light.

Following this fiery conclusion, the narrative returns to the hospital waiting room for Creed, reinforcing the sense of an inescapable situation. He then wakes up alone in Steven's car, stripped of the pistol, his money, cigarettes, and even the car keys. The grim consequences of his actions become apparent as Creed sees Fuel City engulfed in flames. Ultimately, Creed is apprehended by the police at the train station, seemingly after being set up by his brother Mike, who expresses a sorrowful farewell before the arrest. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the chaos, Steven and Erin find a moment of quiet connection, suggesting a potential shift in their relationship amidst the turmoil.

Summary:  
The story centers on Rosie, initially a skinny two-year-old pony whom older horses mock because she prefers playing to practicing. Seeking refuge, Rosie enters the woods where she has a terrifying encounter with a silver, gaunt Coyote. Rosie manages to kick the beast in the eyes and successfully sprints back onto the practice field. Her jockey, Harvey, is impressed by her speed and names her ‚ÄúThe Rocket.‚Äù

Years later, Rosie is a successful 10-year-old racehorse, displaying her numerous gold medals and blue ribbons in her significantly large stall. Harvey celebrates her success but instructs her to look out for and train Biron, a younger horse. Rosie exhibits arrogance, rudely dismissing Biron when he asks to train with her, insisting on being called "Rocket" and bragging about her trophies.

Harvey pushes Rosie to try to jump a high hurdle. During the attempt, Rosie hits the top of the hurdle, spirals toward the ground, and lands awkwardly, resulting in a devastating compound fracture of her front right leg. Harvey calls Dr. Dramer. Dramer informs Harvey that Rosie is out of commission, may never run the same, and recommends euthanasia because the change from racing to grazing would be too severe for her. Harvey agrees to put her down in the morning.

Rosie overhears the plan. Writhing in pain, she begins a careful, arduous escape, limping out of her stall and into the middle aisle of the stable. She encounters Biron, who refuses to help her, condemning her selfishness and promising that her "precious legacy will be run through the mud". Rosie escapes into the woods.

Alone in the forest, Rosie struggles to survive, subsisting on sour green apples as her bandages become dirty and ripped, and her leg continues to bleed. The blind and injured Coyote tracks her scent, forcing Rosie to run until she hides in a cave.

The next day, she meets Isaiah, a rugged gray horse who recognizes "The Rocket". Rosie confesses that she ran away from her jockey who planned to kill her. Isaiah, empathetic to her struggle, guides her toward a community of wild horses. Rosie chooses to shed her former identity, stating that "The Rocket was a symbol" and that the trophies "weren't for me.‚Äù She finds her way to a herd of wild horses in a vast field. When a small pony recognizes her as "The Rocket," Rosie smiles and replies, "Actually, it‚Äôs just Rosie now," signaling her newfound freedom and acceptance.

Student B, a lone audience member, creeps up to attack Student A from behind. Student A swings the metal water bottle, hitting Student B in the head.

Student B flees, pursued by Student A. Student B rushes through the next door, which leads back to the apartment bedroom.
